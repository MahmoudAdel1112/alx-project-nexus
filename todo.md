To-Do List: Movie Recommendation App (Next.js, TMDB, Local Storage, Styled Components, Vercel)
Initial Setup

Initialize a Next.js project with TypeScript support.

Execute npx create-next-app@latest --ts to create the project structure.
Configure ESLint and Prettier for consistent code quality and formatting.
Commit message: feat: initialize Next.js project with TypeScript.

Set up a Git repository for version control.

Initialize a local repository and push to a remote repository (e.g., GitHub).
Commit message: feat: set up Git repository.

Install required dependencies for the project.

Run npm install axios styled-components @types/styled-components for API calls and styling.

Configure environment variables for the TMDB API key.

Create a .env.local file and add the TMDB API key (obtained from https://www.themoviedb.org/).

API Integration

Set up TMDB API integration.

Register with TMDB and obtain an API key.
Create a service file (e.g., services/tmdb.ts) to handle API requests using axios.

Implement functionality to fetch trending movies from the TMDB API.

Create an endpoint to retrieve trending movies (e.g., /trending/movie/week).
Implement error handling and loading states for API calls.
Commit message: feat: integrate TMDB API for fetching trending movies.

Implement functionality to fetch recommended movies.

Use TMDBâ€™s recommendation endpoint (e.g., /movie/{movie_id}/recommendations) or fallback to genre-based filtering.
Cache API responses to optimize performance.
Commit message: feat: add recommended movies fetching.

Dynamic Routing

Implement dynamic routing for individual movie pages.

Create a dynamic route under pages/movies/[movieId].tsx in Next.js.
Fetch movie details from TMDB using the movie ID in the route.
Commit message: feat: implement detailed movie pages with dynamic routing.

Optimize rendering for movie detail pages.

Use getServerSideProps or getStaticProps with getStaticPaths for efficient rendering.
Ensure fast navigation and proper data fetching.

Test navigation between the dashboard and movie detail pages.

Verify that dynamic routes load correctly and handle invalid movie IDs gracefully.

Save Favorite Movies

Implement local storage functionality for saving favorite movies.

Create a utility file (e.g., utils/localStorage.ts) to manage saving, retrieving, and deleting movies in local storage.
Store movie data as JSON objects with essential fields (e.g., ID, title, poster).
Commit message: feat: add functionality to save favorite movies in local storage.

Create a favorites section on the dashboard.

Display saved movies in a grid or list format.
Add functionality to remove movies from favorites.

Handle local storage edge cases.

Implement error handling for storage limits or data corruption.
Ensure data persistence across page refreshes.

Responsive and Interactive UI

Design the movie dashboard using Styled Components.

Create reusable movie card components (e.g., components/MovieCard.tsx) with Styled Components.
Implement hover effects (e.g., scale or shadow) and click interactions.
Commit message: style: design movie dashboard with Styled Components.

Ensure responsiveness across devices.

Use media queries in Styled Components to support mobile, tablet, and desktop layouts.
Test layouts on multiple screen sizes (e.g., 320px, 768px, 1200px).

Add interactive UI elements.

Implement buttons for adding/removing movies to/from favorites.
Add subtle animations (e.g., fade-in for movie cards, button transitions).

Ensure accessibility.

Add ARIA labels for interactive elements.
Test keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility.

Bug Fixes and Testing

Test dynamic movie pages for rendering issues.

Verify that movie details load correctly and handle API failures.
Commit message: fix: resolve rendering issues on dynamic pages.

Test API integration under various conditions.

Simulate network failures or slow connections to validate error handling.

Test local storage functionality.

Ensure favorites persist across sessions and handle edge cases (e.g., storage quota exceeded).

Conduct cross-browser testing.

Test on Chrome, Firefox, and Safari to ensure consistent UI and functionality.

Documentation

Create a comprehensive README.md file.

Include project overview, setup instructions, and TMDB API configuration steps.
Document how to run the app locally and deploy to Vercel.
Commit message: docs: add project setup and API usage instructions.

Add inline comments to key components and services.

Explain complex logic in API services, local storage utilities, and dynamic routes.

Document environment variable requirements.

Specify the TMDB API key format and usage in .env.local.

Deployment

Deploy the application to Vercel.

Create a Vercel account and connect the Git repository.
Configure build settings for Next.js (e.g., ensure environment variables are set).

Test the deployed application.

Verify that API calls, local storage, and dynamic routing work in production.
Check for performance issues (e.g., page load times).

Add deployment instructions to the README.md.

Include steps for linking the repository to Vercel and setting up environment variables.

Final Review

Review code for adherence to TypeScript and Next.js best practices.

Ensure type safety, modular components, and clean code structure.

Verify that all commits follow the specified Git workflow.

Use descriptive commit messages (e.g., feat:, fix:, style:, docs:).

Validate against evaluation criteria.

Confirm functionality (API fetching, dynamic routing, favorites).
Ensure high code quality (modular, reusable components).
Verify user experience (responsive UI, smooth navigation, intuitive interactions).
Check version control (organized repository, regular commits).
